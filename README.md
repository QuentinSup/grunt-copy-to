# grunt-copy-to

Like grunt-contrib-copy but only copies files that have changed and maintains modified times. Useful for creating build directories that can be later synced using tools that rely on file modified times.

## Getting Started
Install this grunt plugin next to your project's [grunt.js gruntfile][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-generator`

Then add this line to your project's `grunt.js` gruntfile:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-generator');
```
